# Python based solutions for the [AOC 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/)

Trying hard to do it with built-in packages ðŸ¤ž

[![tests](https://github.com/saveshodhan/aoc_2021/actions/workflows/github-actions-pytest.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/saveshodhan/aoc_2021/actions/workflows/github-actions-pytest.yml)

## Code structure
> This excludes the common files like `.gitignore`, `README`, etc.

> The `common_<n>.py` may not be present in all folders, only where the code needs to structured separately.

> On my local machine, I also have a file called `input_<n>_my.txt` which is basically the input given to me.
> You will need to have your own input file and execute the code (as mentioned [below](#run-code-for-each-day)) to get the answer to your puzzle.
